## Note Worthy Features
### High FPS
Thanks to Unity, the game is able to run better on lower-end PCs than HaxeFlixel. You can modify the engine's source code to do complicated effects that might cause some lower-end PCs to struggle when done on HaxeFlixel, though you can replicate the effects in Unity and lower-end PCs will run it fine.
### Control Mapping
You can remap your keybinds to any key on your keyboard, but you also have a SECONDARY keybind list that you can use to at any time without having to manually switch it all the time!
### Two Player Mode
The engine natively supports two-player. You and the other player play on the same keyboard. Keybinds for both players are also modifiable.
If the game is set to Two Player Mode, primary keybinds are used for player one and secondary keybinds are used for player two.
### Song Bundles
Bundles are a collection of songs that each can possibly contain custom scripting. Each song in a bundle can contain information such as artist name, charter name, and even an album cover. Bundles can be exported to a .ZIP format and easily shared. If applicable, users can download bundles if they have the download URL via the in-game bundle downloader. Bundles are almost always forward-compatible with future versions of the engine.
### AutoPlay
You just wanna see how that one song is played out? The engine can autoplay any song for you. This depends on your PC's performance, however. Meaning lower performance, the less accurate the AutoPlay will be, but usually AutoPlay will be precise.
### Note Color Customization
This is also a kind of support for the colorblind! You can customize the color of each of the 4 note keys to any color you want, even pure black!
### Offset System
You can test and change your offset for both inputs and notes.
### Sound Channels
Are some voices or music too loud? What if the music is too loud but the voices are not? That's okay, you can choose which sound to turn down separately!

## Requirements for Editing and Building
You will need the Unity Editor and an IDE that can support Unity.

I recommend you install Unity **2020.3.20 or newer** and Visual Studio **Community Edition**. Visual Studio Code can work, and if you wanna be fancy then you could purchase JetBrains Rider.

Also, Unity has an entire manual and C# documentation available online and offline, when selected for download while downloading the Unity Editor.

There is no guide as of yet to help with how to do specific things, unfortunately. No sure when we'll make guides for those.
